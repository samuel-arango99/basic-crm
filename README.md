# basic-crm
A very simple CRM backend prototype using Node.js, specifically with express.

Everything related with the DB is handled locally with MongoDB, using mongoose as the tool to manage the models and the querying inside the code.

This project allows CRM users to keep record of contacts or potential clients to offer them marketing campaigns and sales.
